# **THE AVIATION BUSINESS ANALYSIS**

## **Business Understanding**
Here is a project aimed to help in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircrafts.

This project can be used by anyone with an interest in planes to buy and use aircrafts and also increase knowledge about the aviation inderstry with the comparision of data of the problems and accidents that have ever occured which is critical to prevent present and future accidents in aviation. we gathered data from the national transportation safety Board (NTSB) from years between 1962 to 2023. Our aim is to:
1. help you undertand the causes and preventions for aviation accidents.
2. help you know the reliable and unreliable aircrafts.
3. help you analyze safety measures


The goal of the project is to provide business intelligence about the aviation industry to help venture into new aviation opportunities.

## **Data Understanding**

Data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) includes detailed information on civil aviation accidents and selected incidents. The data has minor and major accidents. 
Key attributes in the dataset include;
- Event date of the accident.
- The location where the accident took place.
- Make, model and type of the aircraft in operation.
- The weather conditions and visibility.
- Conditions of the injury obtained from accidents.

The projects although has some limitations including:
- Missing or duplicate or incorrect data.
- Exaggerated data.
- Outdated or incorrect entered values.
- Market changes and new regulations.

## **Data Preparation**

In this section, we prepare the dataset for analysis by loading data, handling missing and incorrect data, formatting labels and selecting relevant features required. 

## **Data Analysis**
Based on the findings from the dataset, this report proposes three key recommendations that can help:

1. Old models or certain experimental aircraft show high fatality counts relative to their number of accidents
   
   This means that some aircrafts being are survivable when incidents occur, which is very crucial for new business opportunities and knowdledge.

2. Some aircraft are frequently used and appear often not because they are unsafe but because they are widely used.

   Frequency is not equal to risk which means we will need to compare accidents and fatalities per aircraft.

3. Aircraft accidents have declined steadily showing improvements due to newer aircraft models in recent years.

## Recommendations

1. Avoid High-Severity Aircraft in Early stages - aircraft with high fatality- per- incident carry reputational and financial risks.
   Maintenance and/ or pilot error in these aircraft is often unforgiving.

2. Invest in a Proven Aircraft - Choose models that have high visibility in the data but low fatality rate. They should be easy to maintain, widely insured and perfect for both private and commercial use.

3. Match Aircraft choice to Operating Environment - If flying in mountain, rural or variable weather areas choose aircraft with strong records in those settings.
  Choose regionally appropriate, purpose built aircraft to reduce environmental risk.

  # **Data Visualization**

in this section, we will get to manipulate data and use data visualization to compare difffernt kinds of data from the research.

**In conclusion;**

Here is a project aimed to help in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircrafts
